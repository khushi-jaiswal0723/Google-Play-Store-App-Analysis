🌟 Features / Highlights
🔹 Business Problem
With millions of apps on the Play Store, businesses struggle to understand which categories, app sizes, and pricing models perform best in terms of installs, revenue, and reviews.

🔹 Goal of the Dashboard
- Identify top-performing categories by installs and revenue.
- Analyze the impact of app size on installs.
- Correlate reviews vs. installs to highlight customer engagement trends.
- Provide a data-driven guide for app developers and businesses.

✅ Overall Suggestion for Google Play Developers & Marketers:
- Embrace freemium-first strategies (except for games).
- Optimize app size by category (medium-sized performs best in most sectors).
- Leverage reviews as a growth lever with active reputation management.
- For games, prioritize feature richness over size constraints and focus on premium monetization.

🔹 Business Impact & Insights on which these suggestions are based:
1️. Social & Communication- Users install these apps only when free and prefer medium-sized builds.
2️. Games & Family- Users are willing to pay for rich features and don’t mind large-sized apps.
3️. Productivity & Business- Despite high installs, users are reluctant to pay. They favor medium-sized free apps.
4️. Media & Creative- Paid adoption is low, but reviews strongly influence installs. App size has little effect.
5️. Travel & Utility- Paid adoption is weak. Users avoid huge apps, while reviews significantly drive installs.
